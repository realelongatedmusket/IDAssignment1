My Assignment 1 for Interactive Development

My page is designed to allow users to learn more about me both personally and professionally all through an aesthetically pleasing, easily navigatable site. This includes a brief description of myself along with a showcase of the skills and valuable attributes I bring to the table. I added some additional features such as scroll button to provide convenience when navigating the website. 


Design Process

This website was made for potential employers to consider me as a suitable candidate for a job, taking into account my skills and attributes. This website can not only present myself in a fashionable, professional setting, and clearly outlines these skills and attributes I am presenting.

Wireframes

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal. 

As an employer on the website, I want the ability to contact the website creator to suggest potential interest in them. This increases the oppurtunities for both creator and end-user. THis is done through validation of particulars in the form. I would also want the ability to see a clear showcase of skills so as to increase ease of evaluation.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

General:
Responsiveness of website was hard to implement and had success with all screen widths above 425px but had major difficulty with the screen widths below that.

Intro Section:
Go to the start of the website
Pressing the navigation buttons in the navigation bar such as "About" scrolls to the about me page, "Portfolio" scrolls to the start of the skills/attributes showcase, "Contact" scrolls to the contact page.
The page elements re-adjust to fit smaller screen sizes. The navigation bar turns into just the logo and a burger list.

About Me Section:
Go to the "About" section
Pressing "Check out my portfolio" scrolls down to the "Portfolio" section

Portfolio section:
Go to the "Portfolio" section
Pressing the right/left arrows switches the carousel image accordingly.
The buttons at the bottom also update accordingly.
The proficiency bar chart animates to display information. Was not able to animate on entering viewport but instead only on refresh.

Contact Section:
Go to the "Contact" section
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and form is sent and reset when submit button is pressed.
Whole form aligns by column when on smaller screen sizes.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
